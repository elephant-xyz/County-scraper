# 🏠 County Property Data Pipeline

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline to **scrape, parse, transform, and upload** Lee County property data. It processes property records by:

1. Downloading HTML pages for each property.
2. Extracting structured data from those HTMLs.
3. Mapping extracted data into a structured knowledge graph schema.
4. Uploading the final output to AWS S3.
